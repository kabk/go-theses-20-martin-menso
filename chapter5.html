Concluding, from this artistic research, many artists, writers and filmmakers have made nature´s role within technology a focal point of their work. Myths and stories on the phenomena on nature lead back in history and time, and yet we find ourselves until today wondering and questioning our relationship with nature. There seems to be no question among the above mentioned works and thoughts, that nature somehow reminds of the importance of going back to nature, to the untouched forest. Perhaps healing the nostalgia within us, while nature is slowly fading in each successive leap in technology.  Ironically, with each successive leap of technology we achieved the means and tools of recreating our own natural environment on a screen and inevitably changing the way we interact and perceive nature.
<br>
<br>
So the effort of reproducing nature in CGI can be seen as an attempt to clone a dead loved one or as a snake eating itself, it always ends up poorly, in death, ruin and misery. We started off as nature and have evolved into modernity of the non-natural and now somehow we are trying to reconnect or crawl back into the womb of nature through the same technologies that distanced us from it. The way we interact with nature in CGI can be understood as with every leap in technology, we lose something and in the relationship between nature and us, we have to understand we have never spoken and therefore we have a lack for something that never was, a hanging garden of shadows perhaps. Though It is through our present on our screens in our apartment we remember nature, not how it was in the garden of Eden, but as it is in the viewports of our screens.

      Therefore a positive note can be found in Hito Steyerl`s seemingly negative essay, in ways that connecting the idea of a society in free fall as something falling into place, towards our new association of reality, giving place for simulation where we, ourselves define to see everything and anything or none at all. While the ground crumbles beneath our feet – we might have mixed feelings, as a baby leaving the womb, it must feel excited to get out and explore and terrified to leave at the same time.
      <br>
      <br>
      As myself working in the sphere of recreating nature, I have found myself within the reality of having to touch a leaf or the stem of a tree to actually believe it is real. This is probably a feeling that will grow until the whole society has become emotionless to the given reality of nature. In a believe that nature itself does not change but only our perception and relationship to nature is shifting. It therefore, still somehow feels absurd and foolish to call the screen our last saviour but it might be the last refuge for us living in front of screens to sense it.
