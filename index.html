<div class="p1"><h1>ABSTRACT</h1><p>This artistic research discovers different representations of nature through the works of several artists, writers and filmmakers that have put nature in a contemporary context of computer-generated imagery. Contextualising with myths and stories, our quest to understand the phenomena of nature, leading back in history and time, yet finding ourselves until today questioning our relationship with nature. Reminding us of the importance of going back to nature, to the untouched. Perhaps healing the nostalgia within us, while nature is slowly fading in each successive leap in technology. <p/>



With the fast development of 3D technology we achieved the means and tools of recreating our own natural environment on a screen and inevitably changed the way we interact and perceive nature. This prompted leap in technology has changed our relationship with nature at its core, introducing new perspectives. Replacing the stable and single point of view established by the linear through multiple perspectives and vertical time, as 3D technologies are capable of twisting and manipulating reality, pausing time as a refuge of the eternal. With each alternating upswing in technology, we meet our perceived static nature shifting; we fear the distance between us and what is natural, expanding â€” soon to be out of reach. Paradoxically, with each upswing in technology, we have the means to crawl back into new natural environments, artificial, transformed, yet intangible.
