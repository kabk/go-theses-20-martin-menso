      It seems appropriate to start this chapter by mentioning Plato’s Allegory of the Cave.
Many years ago, Plato, one of history’s most famous thinkers said and I rephrase: <i>life is like being
chained up in a cave, forced to watch shadows flickering across a stone wall.</i> The
prisoners or cave dwellers – and the case may be today, screen dwellers – occasionally observing the shadows casted on the stone wall by bodies walking back
and forth holding difference objects alongside a fire.
<br>
<br>The cave dwellers started to name and classify these reflected shadows, believing they were observing real entities, <b>like a child might believe the shadows at night to be real monsters.</b> Sooner or later, one of the cave dwellers was freed from the chains of `ignorance´ and wondered out of the darkness to a world bright and confusing, dazed powered by sunlight. When told that the things s/he now sees when looking at nature and that the trees are real and that the shadows of its complex structure of branches and leaves are merely reflections, s/he couldn't believe it, feeling even greater dazed and confused.
<br>
<br>Eventually the vision of the freed body adjusted to the ultimate source of light – like adjusting to a bright screen in an early winter morning – now observing the objects directly and its shadows merely as reflections, feeling now absolutely awake in the light of sun. Returning to the cave enlightened and eager to explain and teach to the other dwellers that the shadows on the stone wall are merely reflections of objects, freeing them from the darkness of the cave. Yet in their wonders of ignorance and comfort, the remaining cave dwellers found it to be nonsense, stupid and as blind knowledge. Eventually giving up, in the attempt of trying to convince them of freedom, leaving the darkness of the cave for good (Gendler, 2015).
<br>
<br>
The painting by Lalita Hamill [see Figure 1.2] depicts Plato's Cave as a modern interpretation, including women and devices of the 21st century, reflecting its blue, static and cold light of screens and faces holding these devices firmly and with a static and disconnecting gaze. Hamill describes and wonder that Plato would have considered these devices of screens to be something further removed from reality, shadows of shadows perhaps (Hamill, 2014).
<br>
<br>An interesting interpretation in her painting is that shadows are not to be seen, wondering that we, the viewers, are the shadows being looked upon. The myth and Hamill`s interpretation can be understood and read in many abstract ways, but was is important is that it is connected to the theory of forms or idea, which holds that the representation of objects, from our physical world are flawed reflections of its ideal form or idea. Plato saw the world that we live in was not an easy source for eternal truths. A world in movement, where nothing is never constant, things live and die, grow and fade. So in our attempt to render nature on screens, it will always fall short? Although it might fall short it will still exist as Plato argues, since no one has ever seen an ideal form, we can only conceive the idea of a tree in our mind and on our screens, therefore the idea of a tree must exist (Macintosh, 2012). But perhaps merely as a shadow or as a hollow form.

    The toolbox of CGI can render nature such as a forest, its trees and leaves into something truly beautiful and extremely impressive in its realism. Unlike natures faith in the `outside-world ́, the rendered environments are often untouched by humanity’s widespread desecration and abuse of nature, a side effect of modern capitalism and its fetish for commodities. Though, the reality of these pristine generated images of nature is that they do not physically exist, yet they are a mirage of real nature or perhaps a substitute for the lack of nature in a more and more urbanised western society.
<br>
    <br>In CGI the tree does not have a real existence as the physical tree in the outside-world has. This tree only exists as a representation assigned with material appearance, as something that is deconstructed and constructed by photographs and scans [see Figure 1.3], combined into a visual impression of a tree — <i>a collage of collected data</i> — with each of its properties, constructed and assigned to it (Dorsey, Rushmeier, Sillion, 2017).
<br>
    <br> In order for computers to recreate an accurate image of the tree, a construction such as a digital model must be created - a digital model is in essence, ingredients of shape, material and light that produces the visual image of a tree to seem credible to the eye — as a real object — as it appears on the screen. The modeling of digital objects is what gives the means to simulate how the representation of an object like a tree, its trunk and leaves would be displayed, in basic and more understandable terms — how we can copy and paste nature into new natural environments and make it seem realistic.
<br>
    <br>By copy and pasting to form an image for the human perception to understand, we must model the geometry of the shape and describe the materiality of the surface. For instance the shared impression of a tree, is that it has a rugged and bumpy trunk and its leaves are green and vibrant in summer, yellow and fading in autumn, as seasons reflect change. This is a very basic description of a tree, but it works, for example we would not describe the trunk of a tree as a shiny plastic surface and its leaves as bright blue, it would be an absurd tree and we might not longer call it a tree. It would become something else in its representation, a manipulation to our mind, a mismatch of eye and brain. It is the correct description of impressions that forms a credible representation of nature and its trees — it is the vehicle that connects the form to the idea as a subject and object from nature.
<br>
  <br>The final ingredient for the tree to exist as a visual image and also the basic to all existence is a light source, a product that comes from the sun, a lamp or a screen.
It is about how physical light interacts with a tree, how light leaves a source, strikes the tree, and then hits our eyes - it is the combination of these three ingredients of shape, material and light that we now can form an image for the human perception to see a tree on the screen or as its flawed representation.

    The above mentioned rendered image depicts a very static representation of a forest and its trees – a render without performance and growth – without the beauty of nature.  Using the paper: <i>The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</i> (1990) by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristif Lindenmayer, a comprehensive study into the computer simulation of patterns in plant growth and the first part of the four-part video essay: <i>Parallel I-IV</i> (2012-2014) by Harun Farocki, which is an video exploration of the image genre of CGI, where Farocki traces the development of raw computer-graphics from the 1980s to the hyper-realistic of today. In an attempt to render some life and meaning into the hollow computer-generated nature.
    <br>
    <br>
    Trees grow in nature as a natural process of water and sunlight forming a natural pattern of growing branches and leaves on a tree, outputting oxygen for us to breath. <b>In a computer, a tree does not grow by the act of pouring water into it and leaving it in the sun.</b> No the simulation of growth is performed by an algorithm based on the Lindenmayer-system or in short: a L-system. A system that consists of an alphabet of symbols, in this case a branch and a leaf used to make strings, branches and leaves, that expand every symbol, translating the generated strings into geometric structures and voila, trees [see figure 1.4]. The different stages of the growth of a tree, simulated by a L-system is in essence a realistic digital model of an natural growing tree.
It would be too compact to incorporate and understand the whole study made in The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants in this paper. Nonetheless, the essence I want to express, is how plants and trees are visualised and simulated through using algorithms based on the L-system, allowing CGI to render realistic plants and trees, it's structures and growth (Prusinkiewicz, Lindenmayer, 1990). The representation of nature develops therefore from an representational image on a screen, to somehow, something living and growing – its beauty infused by symmetry.

The performative side of nature in CGI as something alive can be made in Harun Farocki’s video essay: Parallel I. His works are well known for exploring the relationship between the production of images and the relation to its cultural context and vice versa. In his video essay that might at first glimpse seems to be a very rudimentary journey through the evolution of computer graphics, from trees represented as green squares in the eighties to hyper-realistic representations of trees today [see Figure 1.5] to a more deep underlying element of the reality of digital produced nature and the digital image itself.

Thomas Elsaesser, writer and professor of film, describes in his article Farocki´s video essay as seeking images to outdo reality itself. Something that Farocki realised at some point in the 20th century, when images began to take characteristics of being alive and growing, taking on a life on their own, rather than being a representation of some reality outside of them. Elsaesser points out that, according to Farocki an era of reproduction is over, and an era of construction of new worlds is here (Elsaesser, 2017). Meaning that algorithms and the machines of image production have started to behave by themselves, introducing a new visual paradigm as an image, not merely a reproduction of the tree as an image but something that nourishes itself and makes it grow. Yet, in one sequence of Parallel I, we are following along the perspective of a virtual camera floating calmly over an ocean surface in a CGI environment, narrated by a calm and philosophical voice-over: <i>“The virtual cameras can dive under these waters, but there is no ocean floor to be seen. The rocks float on the water surface.”</i> (Farocki,2012) [see Figure 1.6]. Something that also became apparent in my own investigation of the reality of nature in CGI, realising the growing grass to be situated floating in space without roots and soil [see Figure 1.7].
<br>
<br>
Leaving me to understand that also the realistic growth of nature prompted by technology and its image-making-machines still creates a hollow meaning and the growing tree retreats back to merely a depiction on a screen for now. Nevertheless, a distinction should be made between the beauty of algorithmic growth and the material appearance made from photographs and scans. The algorithmic growth being somehow the answer of an era of reproduction ending and an era of construction emerging.

With an understanding of how CGI is rendering nature, but not necessarily an understanding of its reason and reality: <b>if it has one and what are the functions of real trees in concrete jungles, anyways?</b> Perhaps they are a memory in our DNA of an ancient world where humans lived side by side and in harmony with nature and as research has shown, trees and green spaces can improve physical and mental health when living in dense cities (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States, 2016). So in a fear that nature is fading in each successive leap in technology and how our subconscious part of our mind — that perhaps isn’t evolved so much from our not so distant selves of being hunters and gatherers — is craving it subconsciously?
</p>

<p class="selfQuote">In our fear of nature becoming soon out of reach, we recreate new natural environments as a substitute or is it some sort of nostalgic desire hidden deep in our minds, a function of refuge?

      In some ways similar to when house plants became popular in the 1950s as to reintroduce vegetation into houses and flats of the postwar era, as something healing and growing. Something artist Ian Bruner from RPG pointed out in my discussion with him about what is the meaning of 3D in his work and how the popularity of house plants in the 1950s is similar in its substitute and healing effect to why nature is being reproduced in CGI today. He is emphasizing that with the urbanization of the world, people are getting more and more distant from their interactions with nature, trees, dirt and unfiltered sun, arguing how our mammalian brain is perhaps secretly craving it, as we have lost or are losing the connection of a nostalgia for the natural of some ancient forest or island once inhabited (Bruner, 2019).
      <br>
      <br>
      Some distant memory in the subconsciousness of modern culture as we continue to evolve from nostalgic houseplant of housewives, to substitute plants on screens. Similarly, in my discussion with other artists dealing with nature in CGI, it became apparent, that their notion of remaking nature in CGI is in a way to connect back to nature because it improved their mental health, but not like a walk in a forest but as an altered and disorientated stroll through the viewport of the computer. When a manipulation or miscommunication between our metaphysical categorization of objects takes place, something interesting happens - for better or worse. Something that became interesting in my discussion with the artist collective: <a href="http://www.mostdismalswamp.com/"><i>@Most_Dismal_Svamp</i></a> which ideas of nature in CGI were very much rooted in a belief that the tools of CGI have the power to explore the mutability of nature — <i>“how nature is not natural”</i> — it can be constructed and reconstructed, zoomed in on or zoomed out of, to an extent where the resemblance to nature is none and the reality of it is lost (MDS, 2019). Forming essentially a new one, a shiny plastic tree with bright blue leaves perhaps and a mismatch of eye and brain is in full effect. It offers a chance to explore the modern division of nature and culture, showing a much more blurry distinction and highlighting that it is becoming harder to believe the constructs of modernity and to distinguish between nonhuman life, us and technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      Bruno Latour argues in his book: <i>We Have Never Been Modern</i> (1991), that the rise of technology and science has changed our modern world with no chance for us turning back, leading us always forward and forever separating us from our so-called primitive ancestors, as modernity has made a dualistic distinction between society and nature  - good or bad, this or that, one and zeroes. He is expressing a rethinking of these ideas, to not see natural phenomena and social phenomena as separate things though functioning as hybrids between non-humans, us and technology (Latour, 1992). And example of meaning could be that nature such as trees and phytoplankton provides us with oxygen that we need in order to survive and how the faith of humanity and nature are therefore very much intertwined, relying on each other.
      <br>
      <br>
      In our deconstruction and reconstruction we also find new functions of nature and perhaps a impression of the rethinking Latour talks about. A glimpse of how CGI can render nature differently, is apparent, in a selected sequence from the video work: <a href="http://www.mostdismalswamp.com/swampprotocol.html"><i>Swamp Protocol</i></a> [see Figure 1.8]. Where nature is being mutated with multiple logics and mixed layers of transparency, blurred and sharp, all at once, perhaps not for better or worse, but definitely for something else. Blurring the distinction between nature and technology, us and that. Enforcing a new idea of nature, mirroring the state of which society finds itself, confused and disoriented.

      A different approach to the use of nature as a statement is found in the artwork <a href="https://www.badenpailthorpe.com/#/asset_pack/"><i>Asset_Pack</i></a> (2019) by Baden Pailthorpe, a work that deals with the culture of late capitalism and in this case the commodities of 3D models of plants that are created and sold online, to be used in 3D environments. Pailthorpe uses these commodities in a different setting than it would be normally used for. He uses these products in ways where he are harvesting this commodities and placing them multiplied and floating [see Figure 1.9] he re-contextualised the 3D objects as artefacts of our contemporary culture of consumption and disconnection of grounding.

      A reflections on the above mentioned, as an transition to the uncertain, modern life is like being chained to the comfort of a screen and its reflections merely shadows of shadows and where nature is depicted on screens as a mirage of real nature or created as a craving by the lack of it. The depictions of nature have perhaps more reality to it, as the era of reproduction is over and an era of the algorithmic digital image is here, an construction that now exists by nourishing itself and therefore breaths somehow. And when nature on screens are not merely representations but entities of their own, we can start to play with the ideas of rethinking nature and therefore also the relationship between it and society, us and that. Therefore, the tools of rendering nature in CGI should perhaps be seen as blank sheet for introducing new ideas of representations, ideas and forms.
