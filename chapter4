      It seems appropriate to start this chapter by mentioning Plato’s Allegory of the Cave.
Many years ago, Plato, one of history’s most famous thinkers said and I rephrase: <i>life is like being
chained up in a cave, forced to watch shadows flickering across a stone wall.</i> The
prisoners or cave dwellers – and the case may be today, screen dwellers – occasionally observing the shadows casted on the stone wall by bodies walking back
and forth holding difference objects alongside a fire.
<br>
<br>The cave dwellers started to name and classify these reflected shadows, believing they were observing real entities, <b>like a child might believe the shadows at night to be real monsters.</b> Sooner or later, one of the cave dwellers was freed from the chains of `ignorance´ and wondered out of the darkness to a world bright and confusing, dazed powered by sunlight. When told that the things s/he now sees when looking at nature and that the trees are real and that the shadows of its complex structure of branches and leaves are merely reflections, s/he couldn't believe it, feeling even greater dazed and confused.
<br>
<br>Eventually the vision of the freed body adjusted to the ultimate source of light – like adjusting to a bright screen in an early winter morning – now observing the objects directly and its shadows merely as reflections, feeling now absolutely awake in the light of sun. Returning to the cave enlightened and eager to explain and teach to the other dwellers that the shadows on the stone wall are merely reflections of objects, freeing them from the darkness of the cave. Yet in their wonders of ignorance and comfort, the remaining cave dwellers found it to be nonsense, stupid and as blind knowledge. Eventually giving up, in the attempt of trying to convince them of freedom, leaving the darkness of the cave for good (Gendler, 2015).
<br>
<br>
The painting by Lalita Hamill [see Figure 1.2] depicts Plato's Cave as a modern interpretation, including women and devices of the 21st century, reflecting its blue, static and cold light of screens and faces holding these devices firmly and with a static and disconnecting gaze. Hamill describes and wonder that Plato would have considered these devices of screens to be something further removed from reality, shadows of shadows perhaps (Hamill, 2014).
<br>
<br>An interesting interpretation in her painting is that shadows are not to be seen, wondering that we, the viewers, are the shadows being looked upon. The myth and Hamill`s interpretation can be understood and read in many abstract ways, but was is important is that it is connected to the theory of forms or idea, which holds that the representation of objects, from our physical world are flawed reflections of its ideal form or idea. Plato saw the world that we live in was not an easy source for eternal truths. A world in movement, where nothing is never constant, things live and die, grow and fade. So in our attempt to render nature on screens, it will always fall short? Although it might fall short it will still exist as Plato argues, since no one has ever seen an ideal form, we can only conceive the idea of a tree in our mind and on our screens, therefore the idea of a tree must exist (Macintosh, 2012). But perhaps merely as a shadow or as a hollow form.
