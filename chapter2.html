      CGI and its journey through the uncanny valley to the frontier of today, has been a journey full of discovery and innovation. In the beginning of the eighties, the representation of nature in CGI was limited, where every shape was formed and built from squares, e.g.  sand out of colored blocks and the notion of moving water by dashes and dots. When in contrast looking at today’s representation of nature in CGI where ultra realistic representations of a tree are created by quick duplications of its leaves and branches, filling the naked skeleton of the tree by a few clicks and tricks on the computer - it seems somehow like magical illusions. A breakthrough towards photorealism in CGI happened in the late-seventies and throughout the nineties, as a result of the personal computer, the <i>Apple II</i> becoming more accessible and powerful, making the <b>`playing ́</b> with CGI, more approachable for the `average ́ Joe or in other words and perhaps more suitable: the hobbyist. The sophisticated <i>Apple II</i>  features meant that it could be employed in a professional capacity as well as in the hobby room.

          The sudden widespread accessibility and appeal to people who had an interest in CGI helped to push innovation forward. Enabling the industries of visual effects to rise and studios such as Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to become pioneers in the production towards photorealistic CGI. Implementing it on an industrial scale, as we see it in cinemas today. ILM is the studio that created the `magic´ behind Steven Spielberg’s <i>Jurassic Park</i> (1993), and <i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</i> (2018), their resurrection of the dinosaurs and their powerful roars has put them into the position of being the largest CGI studio in the whole industry. They are the invisible labour behind Hollywood’s intense use of CGI in many of its movies, produced in a conveyor belt style, where scale and volume is the innovation — how cheap and fast CGI can be put into production — the innovation is not necessarily an interesting one, often creating and applying the same kind of immeasurable and prepackaged effects, creating the same visual output and narrative of many blockbuster movies.

          The pioneers of CGI and in their pursuit for high quality productions of representing natural scenery on the screen, created depictions and understandings through researching nature and how it would be possible to recreate <b>skies, waters, particles, motions, wind, fog, smoke, terrains and trees</b>, by mimicking the image force and materiality of natural scenes in a graphical representation onto a screen e.g. volumetric clouds [see Figure 0.6] <br>These depictions of physical reality became known as a library of simulating and visualising natural phenomena, simplified as the toolbox of nature. This toolbox is known as a CGI software or program, like Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), a powerful program for creating 3D environments or even complete worlds with countless layers. UE4 is making it possible for the hobbyist and not only the computer scientist or the big CGI studios to recreate realistic representations of nature, using the hands on and pre-build tools with its functionality of simulating real physical realities.
<br>
        <br>  This sudden accessibility of softwares and its tools and render engines, that were normally restricted to big production studios with big budgets, are now available for hobbyists and artist alike. The hobbyist therefore got into a position of being able to generate realistic looking nature, by the increasing normality and accessibility of 3D, prompted by technology.
