When wanting to play with the idea of rethinking nature and creating new natural environments — something that seems reasonable to do, as nature is sometimes hard to spot from the cramped windows of city apartments and the fragmented greenery isn't enough— we need a tool. UE4<a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"></a> is that tool and with it, comes a default level and a viewport as a basic. The viewport is essentially our window into the environment we create and as we will explore, it is also a window of alternative views and a new view to reconsider. But for now, let’s focus on what is a default level. The default level is the contribution from the software for us to get started with building for example a forest or a horizonless landscape or where we can create nature with mixed layers of transparency, blurred and sharp, all at once.
<br>
<br>
The default level that we see through the viewport, comes with a starting point, a ground of sorts. But the ground does not seem to have the characteristics of the ground we would normally associate with it, as something we can stand on and touch. This ground gives the impression to be floating within the window of a three-dimensional space, having no `real´ connection to earth — like an electrical circuit without a ground wire<a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote"></a> — taking form as a plane or as a disc floating in space. Something also apparent in game worlds, environments taking form as entities floating in darkness 0r as a forest without a location as seen in the video work: <i>Forest on Location</i> by Broersen & Lukács (2018/2019) [see figure 2.2]. It is a good visualization to sense the state of things in CGI, a forest floating around in empty darkness. Where its leaves are not connected to its branches and the forest bed hollow and lost. It is a fragment of a forest without a location, except on our screen so to say, and therefore it exist somehow.

      These grounds seem to be unstable and at certain points, not even existent and its horizon seems to twirl around, looping and shatter itself when maneuvering around within, a loss of a stable horizon.  Imposed by new technologies and powers of 3D, empowering a form of disorientation but also something we have become accustomed to in today’s society, something we are prepped for through our extensive usage of technology.
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the physical structure of the default level is set up in ways that it mimics the parameters or laws of nature, like gravity, matter and light, something we explored in: The brief notion on CGI, as a natural phenomena. As Castel (2019) puts it’s in his thesis, Cinema of Disillusionment: <i>“It is through these options, which by default are close to reality, that the user creates any type of work. It is therefore easier to create a work that is closer to reality than to produce something that is completely different from it.”</i> (Castel, 2019). Meaning the default level is essentially a plane or perhaps a more understandable term a foundation, for building new natural environments, it is what gives the field of view and depth for the user — a starting point — to not get to disorientated, I guess [see Figure 2.3]. But together with the exploration of the confusing view we will find out that the state of a foundation as something stable is obsolete and the laws of nature perhaps do not apply as stated and the creations of natural environments as something close to reality seems far away: becoming more desirable, unlike natures faith in the outside-world.

    Finding ourselves now in an exciting new space, it still has a structure besides the laws of nature. The other structure is within the edges of the viewport where the creation of the environment happens, where we have the structures and limitations of a fixed view. A view that is central to what happens within the boundaries of the edges of the screen. The viewport is established by the worldview<a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote"></a> and its meaning represented through the way we use it, as Stuart Hall puts it: <i>“It is by our use of things, and what we say, think and feel about them - how we represent them - that we give them a meaning”</i> (Hall, 1997). The viewport of CGI is therefore a part of the users identity and is giving the user a body and therefore a position, a central positing of mirroring itself and its surroundings into the screen.

The journey of altering our use of perspective that Hito Steyerl takes us through in her essay, is a journey where we end up with the situation of linear perspective, in one way or another changed with a orientations towards a society being in a state of multiple perspectives, nonlinear or imaginary time and free fall. Let us reflect on some sentences from her essay to understand the change mentioned above and how it is linked to the viewport and the default level of UE4.<i>“We cannot assume any stable ground on which to base metaphysical claims on (...) At best we are faced with temporary, contingent, and partial attempts at grounding”</i> (Steyerl, 2009). Contextualising the idea of a disrupted ground as an effect of perspective leaving the horizontal, becoming vertical in the sense that new technology of vision has provided us with views from above and distance, detaching us in essence from grounding and from earth itself. Earth as something that holds our grounding of metaphysical claims and within it the dialectic distinction of nature and culture.
<br>
<br>
Leading us to some understanding that the transformation is heading towards a mixed-reality, prompted by technology holding multiple truths, multiple use and mutability and in essence making a blurred distinction between nature and culture. <i>“Paradoxically, while you are falling, you will probably feel as if you are floating” (...) “as if time have ended and you can’t even remember that time ever moved forward”</i> (Steyerl, 2009). As a society falling, does not merely mean falling apart but can also mean falling into place, towards a new association of reality, giving place for hyperreal representation of space, as a simulation where we ourselves define to see everything and anything or none at all, where we decide to recompile ourselves or not.
<br>
<br>
By being in free fall, it might paradoxically feel like floating, just like in space, no sense of time or direction, static. Such feelings of no sense of time is already apparent in post-cinema, where the cultural image is surpassed by computer-generated image, with cinematic cuts, made so rapidly that it is hard to follow along, losing any sense of time, in a linear understanding. CGI has contributed to what Steven Shaviro, a American philosopher terms as <i>Post-Cinematic Affect</i><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote"></a> (Shaviro, 2007). In ways like the virtual cameras are not constrained to real space and can go anywhere in any direction and the idea of the unconstrained view can be seen as a open or new window, and in its essence a God’s-eye perspective for the user or where the users view becomes like virtual cameras, not constrained to real space and can go anywhere in any direction. The idea of the unconstrained perspective of the camera and mind, was already manifested by Dziga Vertov in (1923) and later on in his movie, Man with a Movie Camera (1929) <i>“I free myself for today and forever from human immobility.” — “I am in constant movement”. (...) — “Freed from the boundaries of time and space, I coordinate any and all points of the universe wherever I want them to be.” — “My way leads towards the creation of a fresh perception of the world.”</i> (Vertov, 1984). It is a window into a world where we can view and control matters like nature from a distance, zooming in and out.
<br>
<br>
Leading us to be able to see nature in a different way, rethinking its relationship towards us or perhaps more ethical correct our relationship towards it. In essence the viewport is the confusing window or the paradoxically static framed area on a screen, within a software of CGI, where we can see, construct and control nature. It is here we navigate through the dense vegetation of a forest, just to realise the trees are hollow. It is here we place heavy rocks in space, just to realise that they float and it is here we experience grass growing without its roots planted in soil [see figure 2.4 and 2.5]. It is where the new visual paradigm created by technology superimpose linear perspective and creates new perspective of overview and distance for the creator safely falling infinite.
