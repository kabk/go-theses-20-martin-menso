      The homesick wife of King Nebuchadnezzar the second, Queen Amytis, had been removed from her home, taken away from the vibrant surroundings of her childhood, with all the floral and fauna that existed in her life. A lack had suddenly replaced something, that had created a traceable and touchable link in her memory and inner narrative. This oppressing feeling of being a stranger, consumed her and changed herself and beauty into something undesirable. This lack and sorrow  and perhaps even fear of losing herself, led King Nebuchadnezzar the second to build the hanging gardens of Babylon [see Figure 0.1] for her to find and reclaim herself. The hanging gardens represent and can be seen as a monument to nostalgia and a stand-in for nature.

    <p class="selfQuote">(This depriving lack of nature, that Queen Amytis expressed, can be linked as the starting point of this research)

Nowadays, Babylon ruins lie in modern-day Iraq and nature has become something we can recreate and experience through a screen, with indistinguishable resemblances to real nature. Though it is important to distinguish the difference to the reality of this nature: <i>as something that only exists on a screen, delivered by present culture and its connections to technological reliance.</i> Therefore, in this paper I will explore the reason of creating artificial nature by the means of computer-generated imaginary (CGI), in a connection to myself, as a modern user and others alike.

      Do we seek refuge in artificial alternatives of nature as an answer to an increasingly urbanized western society? We fetishize fake nature from pristine forests created in CGI, to screensavers on our screens, to printed backgrounds in dull offices and even as an image of fresh air in smoking areas. Or perhaps our fetish comes from within our DNA, a desire of us going back to our roots, living side by side with nature, as Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden<a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a> did or as our ancient human ancestors of hunters and gatherers.
    </p>
    <p class="selfQuote">(Since it is true, for most people living in the western hemisphere, natural nature is neither often a choice or something accessible, and only to be found as scarce fragments like single trees and other limited greenery placed in concrete jungles)

  The unnatural on a screen is somehow becoming the natural. And it is through our obsession with being in front of a screen, that depicts nature on it, or perhaps the screen itself becomes something primordial<a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a> as a thing existing from the beginning of time as nature itself. Nonetheless, it would be absurd and foolish to call the screen our only saviour and the last refuge for nature, <i>or would it?</i>

    Perhaps the process and reasons are not something coded in our DNA or as a reminisce of Adam and Eve, though something rooted and enforced by today’s culture of technology and our ubiquitous use of it. How we as a society have been accustomed to the perspectives of distance and control — distortion and confusion — provoked by views rendered through the viewports of 3D and imagery alike<a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a>. It is a transformation from the traditional sense of orientations and it's ideas of classical linear perspective and time: <i>concepts rooted in an observer being situated on a stable ground of sorts, gazing towards a single vanishing point of an imaginable stable line of horizon, with time only moving in one direction: </i><b>forward.</b>
<br>
  <br>To what is now being replaced by the growing impact and normality of 3D, views from a distance, in front of a screen, warped yet something accustomed to be standard. Hito Steyerl, writer and artist coined this as a culture becoming accustomed to what used to be called God’s-eye view. She argues that today’s society is finding itself on unstable grounds or perhaps on no grounds at all, to base metaphysical claims — concepts to help define something intangible as reality and our understanding of it (Steyerl, 2019). It is the idea that the stable and single point of view of the observer established by the linear is now being replaced by multiple perspectives and non-horizontal time, as 3D technologies is capable of twisting and manipulating reality, pausing time, making it vertical<a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a>, abstract and eternal.
</br>
<br>
A disruption of the classical linear perspective was already apparent in the painting: <i>The Slave Ship</i> (1840), by the painter J. M. W. Turner. The painting breaks with classic linear perspective by playing it into a part of the work in ways where s/he, the observer loses it´s stable position, when the horizon line is disturbed and the sun’s reflection multiplied, leaving the viewer disturbed and confused tangling in a mast of sorts [see figure 0.2]. Steyerl points out that our new association of perspective and reality has given place for hyperreal representation of space: <i>“not of space as it is, but of space as we can make it — for better or worse.”</i> (Steyerl, 2019).

The story goes, that the captain ordered the sick and dying slaves to be thrown overboard as his insurance only covered people lost at sea.

      In the belief that our presumed structural elements of perspective and time, are shifting makes me believe that the contemporary ecology of nature and computer-generated imaginary is entangled in a shift towards a new relationship between us and that – screen and eye – culture and nature. Where nature on screens becomes pervasive multifacet, horizonless landscapes and its trees hollow, planted with its roots in non-existent grounds, transparent and fragmented.
<br>
<br>
      A relationship is emerging towards nature as something we no longer perceive, sense and heal from, though something we control, recreate and <b>miss!</b>
